Title=Sek the Slavemaster
BodyText=Hmmm. I see. My scouts have informed me of the Anubians constructing what they thought was a gate; but we had no idea it was so close to completion. We need to destroy that gate, or at the very least make sure it cannot be activated. I am led to believe it's a large structure - so I will consult Karn Vallen. Karn is my trusted aide and a very wise mage. In the meantime, I have a task for you - if you are up for a fight?

Just north of our camp is one of the Anubian camps. It's full of their shock-troops - Simians. Nasty buggers in a fight, but they do not fight for any other reason than they are slaves. The camp is run by a Slavemaster named Sek. He is a ruthless fellow even by Anubian standards. If you could eliminate Sek I am sure most of the Simians would not even fight us any longer! Are you up for this task?
CompleteText=Well done! Perhaps this will give us some reprieve.

Title=The Gate: Gathering the Components
BodyText=Yes, yes, Anubian Gates are interesting devices. You see, they work much the same way the Henges of Europe work; but they can be left open - like a sieve! If they were to open a gate here, then their armies could just pour through - quite bad indeed. Though there is no need for fear! As it turns out, I am very familiar with the inner workings of the magics that power these gates and they can indeed be disabled. There are a few things I will need first.

I can fashion a device that can disrupt the controls of the gate; but I need three things in particular. First, I need one of the amulets worn by an Anubian Magus. As fortune would have it, there is one to be easily found in this area. In the Anubian camp to the southwest you will find Kepi - be careful - he is quite powerful and very skilled with magic. Next I will need some Earth-Ash. Earth-Ash can be found on the corpses of the Smoldering Walkers. Yes, you will have to kill the beasts in order to get what I need. They can be found nearby at the southern ridge and scattered around the northern reaches
of Earthrise. Finally I need some Glinting Stones. Not really a stone, but a crystalline form that is common south of here - especially in the area up where the Vespin hive is.

Once you have these items bring them to me and I can build the device to disable the gate.
CompleteText=Did you gather what I required? Good, good. It will take some time to make the device - but do come back soon!

Title=The Gate: End the Threat
BodyText=I have constructed this magical device. Without getting into the finer points of Anubian Gate magic - the details of "how" it works would certainly bore you to death - this device will disrupt the magic that binds the gate and make it inert. You simply need to take the device to the gate. Once there, you will find two controllers - they flank the gate. You need a fully functional controller - it will have crystals of some type inserted into the top. Now that you have the device, you must simply just interact with that controller. It will create a type of magical feedback nullifying the gate's ability to function! You will have to maintain contact with it for quite a while to get enough feedback to nullify the gate.

There is another darker task to be done here as well. Simply 'breaking' the gate will not be enough. It can be repaired, if even with some difficulty, most likely within a few days. If we really wish to make the gate remain inactive, you must also kill the Master Architect of the gate. The scouts have told me his name is Nehtu.

When you have accomplished these feats, report back to Commander Brighteye.
CompleteText=Well done! I have already heard of your victory - yet there is more work to be done!

Worse, some time ago a massive shard of the Spirit Mother fell from the sky and crashed to the earth, landing just south of town. If that were not enough, our local druidess has fallen victim to the power of the shard. Things are certainly in disarray around here. More pressing right now is another issue. Another smaller shard fragment crashed into the earth just east of here. I am being told that a group of Anubian magicians of some sort have excavated the shard and are performing strange rituals out there. My last report was that they had summoned up some kind of "thing". Thing is the best description anyone could give me. Whatever it is, it is something dark.

My first task for you hero is to travel to the eastern shard crater and destroy this "thing" along with the one responsible for bringing it into this world. She is called Nubiti - a powerful mage. If you are truly a hero - then you should be able to finish this task.

In fact, the Redwine I had you gather was for this purpose. I am convinced that by treating your blade with this concoction I have mixed, you will free her spirit if you kill the wretched spider body she is now imprisoned in! Would you do this?

Title=The Road to Earthend
BodyText=Hero! I have word from the Earthend Warcamp. They could use some help there! Before you go to the camp, though, you will pass by an Anubian Warcamp just north of your destination. In that camp you will find Commander Bakari. He is leading a push to press our troops between the sieged city of Earthend and his newly formed camp. Go to the camp and thin their numbers but also kill Bakari. This should help those at the Earthend camp breathe a little easier. Once that task is completed, report to Garren Greypaw in the Earthend Warcamp.

Good luck!

Title=The Assault: Reclaiming Earthend!
BodyText=The time has come to end the siege of Earthend. The Anubians have too long kept the city and now is the time we must act. I am prevented from using my magic to move troops inside. I assume Akhom has some kind of protective magic against such things. There is another way inside, though. This well leads to another well just inside the wall. I am asking you to enter into the city and kill General Akhom. Friend, worry not! I would not ask you to assault an entire city without a little help. I have cast a weakening spell upon the entire city. The Anubians inside will quickly fall to your might!

Using the well, you will enter the city. I am sure Akhom will not come out to fight you without reason. You must kill his three Captains and then kill his Commander. This will surely enrage him enough to show himself to you and face you in personal combat! You must go quickly - while I do have great power - the effects of the spell will not last forever!
CompleteText=You have done well here and served the people of Corsica and Earthrise as a true champion. Your journey has just begun, though. The world is in peril and in dire need of heroes to stave off the evils that now seek to destroy that which we wish to rebuild. You must now travel to Anglorum to continue your journey. Your road ahead is long and fraught with danger, but if you are a true hero you will vanquish all obstacles that may stand in your way.
