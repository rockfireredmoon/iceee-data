Title=The Battle of North Beach
BodyText=Wha...what? Bastion was reclaimed? That is the first good news I've heard in weeks! You're right, we must not despair. Fight until the last man right?! Okay, well, first thing we need to do is salvage what forces we have left! North Beach is pretty much abandoned save our forces and those blasted Anubians. Take Ares and Jacob with you and look for Drill Sergeant Mann. If anyone is still alive it is him! While looking for him, see if you can locate anyone else who might still be alive! We must rally whatever forces we can find and don't forget to give those Anubians a good tail kicking while you're at it!
CompleteText=AHAHA!!! Look at the three of you!! Still kickin' and swingin'! I love it!! Corporal Anderson's men eh? That little bugger is still around?! Fantastic! AHAHA!! What a GREAT day!!

I should warn you, friend, the Anubians have a massive Simian down there, so might want to get rid of him as well. Good luck!

Title=Biological Warfare: Taming the Lashers
BodyText=So it's quite genius really! I have discovered that the sap from within the Vile Lasher plants here in the Vilegrove contains an interesting, even rather deadly, toxin. Death is guaranteed if enough exposure to the toxin is made with another living thing. Following a bit of experimenting, I have found a way to chemically change the Lasher sap toxin into a gas form. This toxic gas can then be contained within special 'bombs' ready to be transported anywhere you might need them. You can then release the gas into the air by delivering the bombs to the target via a catapult barrage.

Thing is, I just need a few more Vile Lashers to extract the sap from and complete my research. That's where you come in. Take this - it's a sort of 'plant taming device' that will prove quite useful in your task. The shocks it gives seems to mellow the Lashers out once they've become weakened. Bring me three of them and that should provide us with enough sap toxin to completely gas out those Anubians.

OH! Don't worry about being poisoned yourself as the toxin in the sap, while indeed deadly, needs enough direct contact to do the job in it's natural state. Your armor should prevent that from happening. I'll be here preparing my equipment while you're out there.
CompleteText=Excellent, the plant tamer worked! Here, give me a moment to finish these up and you can bring them to Commander Ellis.

BodyText=This camp is a strategic location on this island and abandoning it could help the enemy. We'll destroy the bridge upon our retreat; however, I need you to investigate the Anubian supply camp we hit. Drive back any remaining resistance and if the Captain survived the barrage send him back to his gods too...
CompleteText=Get your tail over here soldier!! You came from the North Beach? Last I heard Anubians controlled the North end of the Island. We've been waiting for them to attack us from both sides, but it hasn't happened. What are they waiting for? Wha...t? North Beach has, eh? Okay, spare me the details; but report this to Sir Lancelot. He'll be thrilled to hear this!

BodyText=Somehow I knew you'd still be alive soldier!  As it turns out, the Anubians have too great of numbers here. ...Fall back to Northbeach, huh. That's quite the plan! If we could retake Corsica, we may still have a shot at this war!

As much hope as this news brings, I can't just head off leaving the people of Southend to die, though. I sent some beasts into the lower district earlier. They went after the Anubians' battle plans; but, they have yet to return. I fear the worst has happened. Go into the lower district and rescue what soldiers you can find. If perchance you are able, locate and retrieve those battle plans too. Only then will we talk about retreat!
CompleteText=I know you couldn't save them all, but you only did what could be done and we're better off for it... The plans! Excellent! Let me hold on to them. There are things we need to discuss regarding the retreat.

I cannot bring these civilians along with me as it's too dangerous and I can't leave them to die here either! Your assignment is to take these civilians to the Warcamp in Earthrise. Corsica may be in dire straits, but Earthrise should still be holding strong.

See that house at the top of the hill? Hidden behind the bookshelf there is a long abandoned tunnel. Hearnsmutt told me that it was once used for smuggling, but it'll now serve as your safe passage to Earthrise! Lead the people where they'll be safer! We'll speak again soon!
CompleteText=What in Gaia's name is this!? Why did you bring all these people here? We're nigh on the brink of destruction here, soldier! There's no way we can afford to protect the lives of a group of refugees from Corsica too!
