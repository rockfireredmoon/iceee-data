Title=Trouble in Corsica!
BodyText=Hail, and well met. I am Sir Lancelot, Knight of the Round in service of the Isle of Anglorum and its king - Arthur Pendragon. I have been dispatched here to put an end to the invasion to the south. Earthrise is under siege by Anubians. We cannot allow them to take the island. I would normally give you orders to head directly south and aid in the fight, but first there is now some kind of new trouble here in Corsica. The isle is becoming infested with strange beasts and monstrous plants. I have no idea if this is some new Anubian plot to further their invasion north or if something else is transpiring.

I want you to get to the bottom of it. Speak with Meer Greenleaf. She is our local druid from the Order of Gaia. She has been investigating the odd events already.

Now go quickly, and good luck.

Title=Plant Samples
BodyText=I am glad you were sent to me. I can really use the help.

It all started a short while ago. Some of the local plants seem to have...well come to life. There are surely some plant creatures in this world; but these plants used to be just your normal, run-of-the-mill, soaking up sunshine type! Now they are walking all over and, in some cases, have become quite aggressive. This is causing mayhem! To make matters worse, very strange creatures have been appearing all over Corsica. I would try to explain but you will just have to see for yourself to believe!

What I need from you is a two fold task. Just across the bridge from Northbeach on the main isle of Corsica are some of these newly-walking around plants. I need some samples from them. I also need samples from unaffected plants in the same area. Bring me five samples of each.
CompleteText=You are safely returned! Let me see the samples.

I sent my assistant out earlier to retrieve them but he has not yet returned. Do me the favor of checking up on him. He is a short trip farther out across the bridge in the small forest grove just off the road. It was a very lovely grove until all of this strangeness began. The local people now refer to it as the Vilegrove. It is overrun with large and often aggressive plants.

Go and make sure my assistant, his name is Ker, is fine and bring back the samples I asked him to gather.

Sounds like some fantasy tale to me! Matters not - what matters is he ran away leaving all the ale behind! I was only concerned about one special keg though. A special brew called Braga Brew! Great taste and also doubles as a cleaner for your blades! Good stuff!

Title=Anglor Dren

BodyText=This...crystal... You see...ages ago, long before they were banished to Tartarus by the Dark Lord Djall, the Titans ruled supreme on the Earth. According to legend, as punishment to the insubordinant Faeries, who were the chief servants to the Titans,  Kronos banished their Spirit Mother, Agalarna, to the depths of space using a comet passing by Earth at that time and sent her traveling through the universe. The Spirit Mother would return, in passing, as her comet flew past Earth after countless eons. After many eons, her spirit became fused with the comet itself. Stories claim that this same comet, known to us Djall's Hammer, also served as the Dark Lord's access route to our world eons ago. The last passing of this comet, however, was met with tragedy as it's trajectory sent it slamming into the moon! You can see the results of the impact in the sky above! For many days, pieces of the comet rained down upon the Earth, each holding a small portion of the Spirit Mother's power. Wherever one is found, strange things happen. There is a large shard in the south on the isle of Earthrise. I suspect this is why the Anubians are so keen on taking the island and why they have left us - thus far - mostly alone. Even small fragments can hold great power - but dangerous power.

Oh, I am rambling on with stories - apologies. To the point: this crystal is a tiny shard of the Spirit Mother. It alone - even amplified by that device, could not cause the entire island to be affected. I would guess that there is a larger device and larger crystal. There is only one beast on this island that could possibly know how to do this and sadly it may be my fault he has.

Anglor Dren was my assistant. I helped him unlock the potential for magic he had. He is a quite potent mage, but he had no plan to learn for any other reason than raw power. I miscalculated his motives - and this is the result.

Anglor has taken up residence in the old lighthouse just north of Dante Manor. I urge you to go there and destroy the device, I will guess Anglor is also to be found inside. Though I am unhappy to even broach this topic - you may have to kill Anglor in order to destroy the machine. I have no love for violence, but we cannot allow these abominations to continue to spread. 
CompleteText=You return! I am sorry you had to kill Anglor - even as misguided as he was. You have done well though! Please take this reward!

I want you to go to the camp and eliminate ten of their number. Maybe a show of force will let them know we are not to be trifled with.

Title=Travel to the Wayside Warcamp
BodyText=This is grim news. If the Anubians complete one of their gates, they could simply open it and flood Earthrise with troops overnight. You must take this news to Garnor Brighteye - the Commander at the Wayside Warcamp in the south. Yes, the bridge has been destroyed by the Anubians but we have another way through. There is a tunnel that links Southend to Earthrise. It was originally used for smuggling years ago - now it is our only way south. There is a secret entrance in the inn. The large bookshelf in the main room conceals a hidden door. In fact, you will be the last to use the tunnel. We cannot risk the Anubians finding it and having easier access to our island.

Go now and be quick! But be wary! The tunnel usually is crawling with unfriendly creatures!
