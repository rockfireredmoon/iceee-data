TEXT=<font size="24"><b>Introduction</b></font><br><br>This is the <b>Book Of Books</b>, and introduces the concept of books into the server and client.

Each page of the book is associated with a single item. These items are defined as a new <b>mIvType1</b> of \
<i>BOOK_PAGE</i> which has a value of <i>11</i>. <b>mIvMax1</b> and <b>mIvMax2</b> are used to to point \
to the <b>ID</b> and the <b>Page</b> that this item provides. 

When the item is looted or otherwise collected, that page in book will be displayed automatically, also
the book can be displayed by clicking on the item in the inventory.  

At any time, the player may view all of their current books in one place, currently using \
the <b>/book</b> command, but I intended to add some way in the UI of opening these. The \
page must be somewhere in the players inventory, be it bags or vaults.

TEXT=<font size="24"><b>Defining Books</b></font><br><br>Books are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/rockfireredmoon/iceee/tree/master/Books">Books</a> directory of the static data, using the following format :-

\[BOOK]
\TITLE=Some book title
\[PAGE]
\TEXT=Some book text.
For page 1 
\[PAGE]
\TEXT=Some book text.
For page 2
..
..
..
\[PAGE]
\TEXT=Some book text.
The last page.

Each book is contain inside 1 file inside this directory, named <b>[bookId].txt</b> where [bookId] is a unique
number, it doesn't matter what this number is, but by convential should be sequential, and is used to tie the
book item definition to this book text.  

Book text may span multiple lines, as once 'TEXT=', any text after this point up to either the next [PAGE] or \
the end of file will be part of that pages text. If you want two lines to be joined together, end the line with
a backslash (\). To add a line literally, begin it with a backslash (\).  

The book text itself uses a very restricted subset of HTML (this actually uses the component \
as is used in other areas of text display such as the IGF).

Supported tags include :-
&lt;b&gt;some text&lt;/b&gt; Bold text
&lt;i&gt;some text&lt;/i&gt; Italic text
&lt;br&gt; Break to a new line 
&lt;font color="#ff0000" name="MaiandraOutline" size="18"&gt;some text&lt;/font&gt; Set font size, name or color
