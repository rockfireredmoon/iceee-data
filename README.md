# iceee-data

Data for the IceEE Earth Eternal Server. This module should be cloned into the same parent folder as 
the server module if used with the default ServerConfig.txt.

Make sure you checkout the branch appropriate for the edition of the game you wish to run.

** Note, this separated data module is only intended for use the the TAWD version of the server,
i.e. the current focus of develop, the master branch. The valkals_shadow branch of the server 
are not compatible with this data layout **
